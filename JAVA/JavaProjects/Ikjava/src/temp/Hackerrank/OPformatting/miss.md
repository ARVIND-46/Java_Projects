Q- Here i am attempting to simply concatenate the string 15-length of the string
using string formatting
as mentioned here "Output Format

In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly  characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly  digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

Sample Input

java 100
cpp 65
python 50
Sample Output

================================
java           100
cpp            065
python         050
================================"

here is my code till now "package temp;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Rwork{

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("================================");
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
            String s1=sc.next();
            int x=sc.nextInt();
            //           //Complete this line
        int lastposition=s1.length()-1;
        String strnew=String.format(%lastposition);


        }

        System.out.println("================================");
    }
    }
"
suggest me for improvements and honesly tell how is my approach

ANS====Your approach is on the right track, but there are a few things that need adjustments:

1.  **String Formatting**: You're using `String.format` which is correct, but the format specifier `%lastposition` is incomplete. You need to specify how you want to format the string and integer. In your case, you want the first column to be left-justified with a width of `15` characters, and the integer to be zero-padded to `3` digits.

2.  **Printing the Result**: After you've formatted the string, you need to print it.


Here's an improved version of your code:

javaCopy code

`import java.util.Scanner;  public class Rwork {      public static void main(String[] args) {         Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);         System.out.println("================================");         for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {             String s1 = sc.next();             int x = sc.nextInt();             int lastposition = s1.length() - 1;             String formattedString = String.format("%-15s%03d", s1, x);             System.out.println(formattedString);         }         System.out.println("================================");     } }`

Explanation:

1.  `String.format("%-15s%03d", s1, x);`:

    *   `%-15s` formats the first argument (`s1`) as a left-justified string with a width of `15` characters.
    *   `%03d` formats the second argument (`x`) as an integer, padded with leading zeroes to a width of `3` digits.
2.  `System.out.println(formattedString);` prints the formatted string.


With these changes, your code should produce the desired output.
