### Hashing

* HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called **hashing**.
* Unique only
* null allowed
* Non sync --> thread safe
* insertion order is taken care of by **_hashcode_**
* Best for **SEARCH**
* The initial default  
* capacity of HashSet is 16, and the load factor is 0.7 



* Difference between List and Set  
  * A list can contain duplicate elements whereas Set contains unique elements only.
