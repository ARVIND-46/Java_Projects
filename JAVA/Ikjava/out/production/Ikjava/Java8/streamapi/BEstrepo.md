Java is the undisputed king of the Enterprise Software development and one of the top in-demand programming languages overall. It has recently celebrated its 25th birthday, and it will remain one of the leading programming languages in years to come.

With over 100 million repositories, GitHub is like the “Library of Alexandria” in Software Development. GitHub contains Frameworks, Libraries, Tutorials, Books, and even Programming Languages.

If you are a Java developer and you want to sharpen your Java skills, then GitHub is like a Gold mine for you. But finding the right repository from the GitHub is like finding a needle in a haystack.

By reading this article, you will learn about 10 excellent Java GitHub repositories about:

*   Tutorials
*   Learning Materials
*   Software Design skill
*   Demo Apps


1\. Java Design Patterns
========================

Source: GitHub

Software Design Patterns are the reusable, general solutions for the Software Engineers to solve recurring problems in Software Design. It also gives a common vocabulary to discuss the common issue among Software Engineers and Architects. Design patterns can improve Code Quality and coding velocity by using the battle-tested and proven development paradigms. The best way to learn the design patterns is to see them in action, i.e., Code examples.

This excellent GitHub repository has Java implementation of all sorts of Design Patterns: from the most common and old design patterns (Iterator, Singleton) to the most modern design patterns (aggregator Microservices, Serverless). This GitHub repository will not only improve your coding skill but also make you a better and productive developer.

If you are a Java Developer, you will need this GitHub repository from the beginning of your career till your retirement.

2\. Interviews
==============

Source: GitHub

Giving an interview for a programming job is challenging. Many people just go to interview half-prepared and later blame their luck for failing to grab the Job. Solid preparation for an interview will skyrocket your chance to get your dream job. This GitHub repository contains everything you need to prepare for interviews: YouTube videos, Articles, Live Coding Practice, Data Structures, Algorithms, Interview Books, Video Lectures. Interviews also contains Leetcode for common coding problems in Java.

It is another impressive GitHub repository not only for the Java developers but also for all developers. You will probably need to visit this GitHub site throughout your career.

3\. Algorithms
==============

Source: GitHub

If you are a Software Engineer, then algorithms are the bread and butter of your day-to-day life. Using the right algorithms can improve the Performance of a Software. Often the ability to choose the right algorithm for the given constraint (CPU Complexity, Memory Consumption) indicates the quality of a Software Engineer. It is no wonder that the algorithms are heavily used in the Interview Process: whether it is Tech Giant companies like Google, Microsoft, or a Startup company.

If you are a beginner or mid-level Java developer, then you will need this GitHub repository regularly. If you are a seasoned Java developer with years of experience, you still will find this GitHub repository useful.

4\. Realworld
=============

Source: GitHub

If you are developing modern Fullstack applications in Java, the chances are quite high that you are using one of the latest JavaScript SPA in Frontend and Java in Backend. Realworld offers developing an application “Conduit” (a Medium clone), using almost all combinations of Frontend and Backend. The creators call it “The mother of all demo apps,” as it allows developing a real-world app. Considering the vast Catalog of the Front-end/Back-end Technologies it supports, Realworld certainly fits the Tagline.

Currently, it supports all possible JavaScript Frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, AngularJS, Ember.js, Aurelia, Vanilla JS …) and all possible Backend frameworks in all mainstream programming languages. In Java, it supports Quarkus and Vert.x.

Realworld is also a GitHub repository you need throughout your career, especially if you work in Fullstack development.

6\. Baeldung Tutorials
======================

Source: GitHub

If you are a Java developer, you probably would have come across the various tutorials and examples provided by Baeldung. Currently, it is the number one online source of the Tutorials in Java, Web, and Spring development. What set Baeldung apart from other similar sources is that it covers from the basic to the highly advanced topics in Java/Spring Development. Apart from tutorials, it also contains courses, guides, ebooks, etc. Another vital feature of Baeldung is all the examples and tutorials are backed by running GitHub codes.

This GitHub repository contains a collection of small and focused tutorials in the field of Java and Spring development, including the link to the tutorial article where the code is explained more elaborately. This is also a must-have repository not only for Spring developers but also for Vanilla Java developers.

8\. RxJava Android Samples
==========================

Source: GitHub

In recent years, Reactive programming is gaining massive popularity by offering a nice abstraction to deal with asynchronous and event-based programming. RxJava is the Java implementation of the ReactiveX, which offers reactive programming via Observables. Learning Reactive programming in Java is a bit challenging as Java, by default, provides the Synchronous way of programming. In this GitHub project, real-world examples of RxJava is given. Although the examples are given for Android development, Java developers can easily apply them for non-Android development as well.

9\. Java8 Tutorial
==================

Source: GitHub

Java8 is one of the most disrupting and innovative Java released as it has introduced “Functional Programming” in Java. With concepts like Lambda and Streaming, Java finally reached the functional programming landscape while keeping its legendary and holistic backward compatibility.

Unfortunately, not all Java developers are taking full advantage of Java’s new capabilities. I have seen many experienced Java developers who are still developing Java programs in an old-school way. One of the reasons is that as Functional Programming is a paradigm shift compared to the traditional Object-oriented programming, developers want to remain in their comfort zone.

This GitHub repository contains many small and useful examples of the Functional Programming concepts (Lambda, Streams, Functional Interface, Parallel Streaming, etc.) written in an excellent, readable way. If you are new to Java Functional Programming, this repository will help you immensely.

10\. Cracking the Coding Interview in Java
==========================================

Source: GitHub

Whether you are applying for a Programming job in Fortune 500 company or a startup, you will probably go through a coding interview. The highly acclaimed book “Cracking the Coding Interview” will help you to prepare for the challenging coding interview. This book covers all types and sorts of coding challenges, including Algorithmic complexities, Math and Logic puzzles, Dynamic Programming, sorting and searching, Multi-threading, and many more.
