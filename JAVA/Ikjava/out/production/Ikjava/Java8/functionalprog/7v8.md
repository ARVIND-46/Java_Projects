What change has been done here?

Certainly! Let's compare the Java 7 approach with the Java 8 approach using code examples.


**Java 7 Approach:**
```java
// Interface defining the activity
interface MakeBeverage {
    void make();
}

// Class implementing the interface
class MakeCoffee implements MakeBeverage {
    @Override
    public void make() {
        System.out.println("Making Coffee");
    }
}

// Class implementing the interface
class MakeTea implements MakeBeverage {
    @Override
    public void make() {
        System.out.println("Making Tea");
    }
}

// Executor class
class BeverageMaker {
    public void makeBeverage(MakeBeverage makeBeverage) {
        makeBeverage.make();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BeverageMaker beverageMaker = new BeverageMaker();
        MakeCoffee makeCoffee = new MakeCoffee();
        MakeTea makeTea = new MakeTea();
        beverageMaker.makeBeverage(makeCoffee);
        beverageMaker.makeBeverage(makeTea);
    }
}
```

**Java 8 Approach:**
```java
// Interface defining the activity
interface MakeBeverage {
    void make();
}

// Executor class using lambda expressions
class BeverageMakerWithLambda {
    public void makeBeverage(MakeBeverage makeBeverage) {
        makeBeverage.make();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BeverageMakerWithLambda beverageMakerWithLambda = new BeverageMakerWithLambda();

        // Using lambda expression to define behavior
        MakeBeverage action = () -> System.out.println("Make whatever beverage you want!");

        // Passing the behavior directly
        beverageMakerWithLambda.makeBeverage(action);
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**

*Java 7 Approach:*
- More traditional approach.
- Separate classes (`MakeCoffee` and `MakeTea`) are created for different beverage-making methods.
- Each class represents a different way of making a beverage.

*Java 8 Approach:*
- Utilizes lambda expressions for more concise code.
- No need to create separate classes for different beverage-making methods.
- The behavior is defined directly in the `main` method using lambda expressions.

In summary, the Java 8 approach leverages lambda expressions to directly express the behavior of making a beverage, leading to more concise and expressive code. It eliminates the need for creating separate classes for different methods. This approach is particularly beneficial when you want to pass behavior as parameters or store them in variables.

### About not implementing interface

In the code you provided, you have defined an interface named `MakeBeverage`:

```java
public interface MakeBeverage {
    public void make();
}
```

This interface has a single method `make()`.

You then have a class `UsingJava8` that has a method `makeBeverage` which accepts an object that implements the `MakeBeverage` interface. This method calls the `make()` method defined in the interface.

In your `main` method, you're using lambda expressions to create instances of the `MakeBeverage` interface on the fly. These lambdas define the behavior of `make()` for each instance. For example:

```java
MakeBeverage makeHotchocolate = () -> System.out.println("Steamy hot chocolate ready for you!!\n" +
        "üç´‚òï");
```

Here, you're creating a `MakeBeverage` instance that, when its `make()` method is called, will print out the specified message.

The reason your code works without explicitly implementing the `MakeBeverage` interface in a class is because you're using lambda expressions. In Java 8 and later, you can use lambda expressions to create instances of functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method). This is what you're doing when you create instances like `makeHotchocolate`.

So, in your code, you're achieving polymorphism through the use of functional interfaces and lambda expressions. You're able to define different behaviors for the `make()` method without having to create separate classes. This is a powerful feature introduced in Java 8.
